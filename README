this is buggy and hacky as all heck

what I wanted was to generate a 3d mesh of a selected brain area from a stack of labeled brain atlas images

Steps:
1) take eps files of a brain atlas
2) find location of a selected area label within each eps file
3) render eps file to bitmap format
4) find pixels that correspond to the border of the selected area
5) map image to brain coordinates
6) output 3d brain coordinates for border of selected area at each slice
7) use meshlab to generate mesh from points

this is terribly hacky and relied on:
1) a pre-defined bounding box that I manually put in each eps file
2) only using sections with a simple pixel -> brain coordinate mapping
3) manually generating the mesh using ball-pivoting in meshlab

what I would really like is to
1) automatically find bounding box
2) make a more flexible mapping for all atlas slices
3) automatically generate mesh

Meshlab
-------
1) load in a points file for an area (ex: V1.asc)
2) simplify the points:
    Filter -> Cleaning -> Merge: ~.05 world units
3) save as mesh (ex: .ply)
4) reload
3) mesh the points:
    Filter -> Remeshing -> Surface Reconstruction (ball pivoting): ~.5 world units (or .7 for V2L)
5) close holes
5) smooth:
    Filter -> Smoothing -> Laplace Smooth: 2 iterations
6) save as mesh (ex: .ply)
